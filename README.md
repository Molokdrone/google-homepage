This is the first project from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

Building a replica website (google.com) using HTMML, CSS and the devtools.

I have finished the header (search bar, nav) and the results section.  I have a good grasp on HTML, CSS, and the devtools so I am going to proceed before finishing the footer as this is just time consuming at this point.
